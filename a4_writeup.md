# Assignment 4 - Writeup

In assignment 4 we created a basic tic tac toe game so that we could learn object oriented programming. Respond to the following questions.

## Reflection Questions

1. What was the most difficult part to tic-tac-toe?
The most difficult part for me in the tic tac toe part was to make the player postion because I had no idea how it should be formatted/ coded.

2. Explain how you would add a computer player to the game.
A way you could incorporate a computer player to the game is by possily asking it to pick a random number from 0-8 and if it picks a spot already placed it would pick another random number until it picks an open spot. 

3. If you add a computer player, explain (doesn't have to be super technical) how you might get the computer player to play the best move every time. *Note - I am not grading this for a correct answer, I just want to know your thoughts on how you might accomplish it.
How I think you might is the robot reads the different combinations to win then reads over the positions on the board after the player sets move and then instantly sends it back to the computer and then it keeps going until it wins.
